## Contacts

This is a guide to use my contact manager application.


### Contacts List

When you open the app, you are greeted with the list of contacts currently entered in the application.

To add a new contact simply click the ![New Contact](http://i.imgur.com/fRBw4hh.png) button.

Once you have a few contacts, you might want to sort them.
To do so, tap the ![Sort Contacts](http://i.imgur.com/rZCcCPL.png) button.
This will bring up a drop down selection menu with different sort options.


### Creating a new contact

At the new contact screen, enter as many details as you wish.

When you've finished press the ![Done](http://i.imgur.com/R3qpmny.png) button to save the contact.
This will take you back to the list of contacts. Look, you're freshly added contact is there!

If you want to cancel creating a new contact, press the ![Discard](http://i.imgur.com/jXzgIQc.png) button.


## Viewing a contact

To view the contact's details, simply tap the contact you wish to wish to view more information about.

A new screen will open. If you wish to edit the contact, press the ![Edit Contact](http://i.imgur.com/vT7hieP.png) button.

To delete a contact, tap the ![Delete Contact](http://i.imgur.com/jXzgIQc.png) button.


# Editing a contact

Editing a contact is just like creating a new one.

When you've finished press the ![Done](http://i.imgur.com/R3qpmny.png) button to save the contact.

If you want to cancel the edit, press the ![Discard](http://i.imgur.com/jXzgIQc.png) button.
